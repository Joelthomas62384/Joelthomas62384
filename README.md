## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **self-taught Python developer** committed to building **scalable** and **user-friendly applications**.  
With strong expertise in:

- 🐍 Python, Django  
- ⚛️ JavaScript, TypeScript, React  
- 📨 Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ  

I’m confident in my ability to architect and develop almost anything as a developer.

I specialize in modern architectures like:

- 🏗️ MVT (Model-View-Template)  
- 🧩 Microservices  
- ⚡ Optimistic UI  

These patterns enable me to craft applications that are **resilient**, **efficient**, and a joy to use.

> I believe great products are born at the intersection of clean code, thoughtful design, and solid architecture.
